# vuejs-component-routing
VueJS component routing without using vue-router.

A simple way to navigate between components in VueJS without using vue-router. Inspired by OnsenUI component navigation after default Android browser and Firefox fail to load contents in a routed component.

Use in your Cordova Projects or anywhere you do not need vue-router.
